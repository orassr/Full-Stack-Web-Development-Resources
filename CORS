fixing CORE police:
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/{controller}/' from orogon 'http://localhost:4200' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: no 'Access-Control-aLLOW-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

Solution: 
at the Startup.cs file add:

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddDbContext<StationsDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(
                    Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

            services.AddScoped
                <ISomeRepository, SomeRepository>();

            services.AddMvc()
                .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

            services.AddCors();

        }
        
        
        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app,
            IHostingEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }

            // Shows UseCors with CorsPolicyBuilder.
            app.UseCors(builder =>
               builder.WithOrigins("http://localhost:4200"));

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseMvc();
        }
        
        
        
        At the launchSettings.json file, will have to disable the https connection ONLY for development environment(dont forget to re-enable):
        
        "PsServer": {
        "commandName": "Project",
        "launchUrl": "api/values",
        "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
        },
        "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
        /*"applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000"*/
        },
        "Docker": {
    },
